Some people advocate creating artifacts (packages, tarballs, anything), 
so that you have an authoritative, unchangable source of truth for your deployed application revisions on the contrary to
deploying directly from git branches, which are fungible and can be rewritten or destroyed.

Google - I was asked “How would you create your own hash function?” and 
“How would you implement a red-black tree?”. 
I didn’t like this because the latter required previous knowledge of a specific algorithm and the former required math knowledge.

Amazon - “Create a method that finds the Nth term in the Fibonacci sequence both recursively and iteratively and 
the efficiency analysis for both”. I liked this because the efficiency analysis solutions were fairly unique.

1. DFS
2. BFS
3. Matching Parenthesis problem
4. Using Hash Tables
5. Variables/Pointers manipulation
6. reverse linked list (duplicates , removing duplicates)
7. sorting fundamentals (quicksort, mergesort,bubblesort techniques, runtime of a sort,time space complexity)
8. Recursion
9. custom data structures (object oriented programming)
10.Binary search

Facebook - “Sort this list of an object that has 3 states.” 
The interviewer then iterated the problem around 4 times, forcing out 5 different solutions with 4 different optimizations. 
For example, One utilized indexes, another had a no extra memory constraint, another had a constraint of being stable. 
He had me code several of these solutions and one of the solutions in the last 4 minutes of the interview.
