### Unix Architecture
The main concept that unites all the versions of Unix is the following four basics −

#### Kernel
The kernel is the heart of the operating system.
It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like **memory management**,** task scheduling **and** file management**

**Shell** − The shell is the **utility that processes your requests**.
When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want.
The shell uses standard syntax for all commands.
**C Shell, Bourne Shell (bash) and Korn Shell** are the most famous shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.

**Commands and Utilities (Program)** − There are various commands and utilities (Programs) which you can make use of in your day to day activities.
**cp, mv, cat and grep, etc.** are few examples of commands and utilities.
There are over 250 standard commands plus numerous others provided through 3rd party software.
All the commands come along with various options.

**Files and Directories** − All the data of Unix is organized into files.
All files are then organized into directories. 
These directories are further organized into a **tree-like structure** called the **filesystem**.
